## üíª Installation & Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn
- Git

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd cnc-calculator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
